# Movie Planning

## Project Idea:

The "Movie Planner" project aims to help users easily explore and manage their movie choices. The application allows users to search for movies based on title, year, genre, and language. Users can add movies to their personal watchlist and create a task list related to their movie plans, such as picking snacks or organizing a viewing party. The app features a simple and appealing user interface that facilitates easy navigation and quick access to desired information. Through this project, we aim to provide movie enthusiasts with an enjoyable and efficient experience in planning their viewing activities.
